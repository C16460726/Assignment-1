# Assignment-1
### Idea
The idea for this project came from the well-beloved film franchise Star Wars. This UI is for a space battle in, however instead of it being from the perspective of the rebels, it's from the perspective of a TIE fighter, which are the spacecrafts that belong to the Empire.

### Instructions For Use
##### Aiming: 
The first piece of UI that I added in was the aiming system. This is the first thing the user will notice as it is always being displayed except for when the cursor is over the radar. Once the mouse is pressed this will cause the gun to be activated and it will shhoot two green beams just like the TIE fighters in the Star Wars movies. If the aiming reticle is placed over one of the x-Wings then a pink frame of the X-Wing will appear in a small console so that the user can shoot the X-Wing down.
I am proud of the aiming reticle as I feel it looks professional.
I am also very proud of the targeting system as this reminds me a lot of the aiming system from the TIE fighters in the Star Wars movies.

##### Radar:
It is a typical radar however the rest of the screen is mapped onto the dimensions of the radar which allows the radar to display the X-Wings in their proportionate location from the screen.

##### Xwing:
There will always be two X-Wings in front of the TIE fighter, once you use the shooting ability and the xwings are in the targeting system console, the xwing will start descending downwards and an faded orange circle will appeargiving the impression that the X-Wing is on fire.
After they swirve off screen, they will be relocated at the top of the screen and they will fly in again back into their original position, this will give the impression that these are new X-Wings flying in to replace the older ones that were just shot down.
I was very happy with how these turned out as it reminds me very much ofthe look of X-Wings in the Star Wars movies.

### Coding of Assignment
My main focus from the beginning was to make sure the program was written in such a way that the would make it very easy to edit it if I needed to. As a result I used object classes to build my program from the ground up. This made it very easy to alter my code or debug it if there was ever any problem. This also helped with creating new classes as there was not a lot I had to rearrange in order to add new code in.

The order ofwhich i wrote each piece of functionality is as follows:
1. Aiming
2. Radar
3. Border
4. Stars
5. X-Wings

Now while this list is the basic overview of the order that each class was written up in, it is not entirely accurate. I mainly built each class simultaneously from the ground up. This madeit easier to ensure that the classes worked together to build the UI you see before you.
