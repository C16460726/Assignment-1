# Assignment-1
### Idea
The idea for this project came from the well-beloved film franchise Star Wars. This UI is for a space battle in, however instead of it being from the perspective of the rebels, it's from the perspective of a TIE fighter, which are the spacecrafts that belong to the Empire.

### Instructions For Use
##### Aiming: 
The first piece of UI that I added in was the aiming system. This is the first thing the user will notice as it is always being displayed except for when the cursor is over the radar. Once the mouse is pressed this will cause the gun to be activated and it will shhoot two green beams just like the TIE fighters in the Star Wars movies. If the aiming reticle is placed over one of the x-Wings then a pink frame of the X-Wing will appear in a small console so that the user can shoot the X-Wing down.

##### Radar:
It is a typical radar however the rest of the screen is mapped onto the dimensions of the radar which allows the radar to display the X-Wings in their proportionate location from the screen.

##### Xwing:
There will always be two X-Wings in front of the TIE fighter, once you use the shooting ability and the xwings are in the targeting system console, the xwing will start descending downwards and an faded orange circle will appeargiving the impression that the X-Wing is on fire.
After they swirve off screen, they will be relocated at the top of the screen and they will fly in again back into their original position, this will give the impression that these are new X-Wings flying in to replace the older ones that were just shot down.
